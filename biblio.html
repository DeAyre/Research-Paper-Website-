            included four examples of real-world cars that use the autopilot feature and that there are 
            six levels of self-driving cars ranging from slightly autonomous to fully autonomous. I put

                made self-driving cars. I used the information provided in the article to further establish my

                <br> In this news article it talks about the unfortunate death of two individuals that was caused by
                Tesla's autopilot feature. A method that this article used was keeping the summary of the
                whole incident and case relatively short. Findings included descriptions of how the incident
                occurred such as the tesla speeding off a freeway and running into a red light; also, how the
                federal government not only have been keeping tabs on incidents like this, but they also
                hold tesla primary responsible for any incident that occurs with autopilot as they scramble
                to create regulation for AVs. This article was mostly used to help with security aspects that surround AVs to better connect the reader with real world circumstances. This article was
                also brought up in legal things surrounded by AVs as it did mention regulation

            <br>(Interview Video)<br>
            <br>This is an interview of sorts that an investigative reporter for CNN did on a Tesla model 3 selfdriving feature. The reporter testing the car took it to both a busy street in a city and a
            simple straight-forward road on the outskirts of the city using the self-driving feature to
            navigate his way through. In the video I saw the numerous amounts of time the reporter
            had to take the wheel of the car when he drove through the city and sometime the car
            would hesitate to make decisions due to the hectic nature of the city. During the outskirts
            drive the car did much better, only really having to drive on a quite simple road. This video
            was used as more of a backup on how AVs still need some more work done on them before
            they can go out to the public. </p>

            rest of the article expands as a timeline for things such as companies developing AVs,
            testing within cities, making AVs busses or metros that will also make transportation more
            reliable. The timeline itself was the most interesting find within the article as it gave very
            vivid details on what the future of AV’s could possibly look like. This article was applied
            for future uses within my paper, only due to the fact it gave me an incredible timeline to
            use and offered suggestions that changed my mind on AVs. One of these suggestions
            included making all AVs electric powered instead of the harmful gasoline power. </p>

            <br>This journal asked the question of who will be responsible when it comes to car crashes that
            involve AV’s. The author appealed to the Logos of the audience by reminding them of the
            challenges cars must go through that regular people can go through. The legislation that
            was passed and laws signed in place were things I found to be interesting in a journal that
            talks about car crashes. This was mostly used for legal aspects of my paper as the
            legislation report became handy for background. I also used some inspiration from the
            article within the ethical aspect of owning an AV.</p>

            <br>The article was a given suggestion from another classmate that describes an ethical dilemma all

            interviewing people from the Eastern Hemisphere (Asia) to the Western Hemisphere (Americas).
            Things I founded interesting was the Dilemma presented and how even humans fumble ethically
            on trying to solve it, so imagine AI trying to solve the Dilemma. This was a good question for
            trying to ethically question the AI of the self-driving feature. It called into questioning and
            proving that AVs cannot think nor react to the same as a human. </p>

            <br>This showed me the models, features, and cost for all tesla vehicles. Methods used were tabs,
            pictures, great car descriptions and model inventory. The self-driving feature was a feature that is
            paid for separately than the tesla itself, no tesla car comes with the autopilot feature up front. I
            wanted to discuss that self-driving cars should be cost friendly to the average worker; Tesla's
            were the best examples on AVs. I created a basic model tesla on the website custom feature with
            only making the autopilot being the only add on. </p>

            that took place such as crashes and congress investigations. Findings were more of how the

            an entire paragraph that told users they must pay attention to the road when they use autopilot.
            This went along with my security aspects due to it pointing out the clear and simple instructions

                This is a T-1000 cybernetic humanoid cappable of destroying all life forms on earth. But for now he makes my website look amazing.
                I chose this image as to represent the fears people had with AI. Most people see AI as a means to end human life and destroy our world, But AI is
                built to help us and extend the human mind. This relates to my topic as both have dealings with the Ethics of AI, and there involment of human compacity.

                This image is one of a man having money rained on him. I chose this image to express how legislation for AV's often leads to heavier cost in insurance 
                and payout to people who are involed within an car crash. It also is to mention that companies pay alot of money to constantly test out the saftey of these vehicles. 
                AV's often come with cost for both sides, so what better to express that than an image of it raining money. The image is relevent to this day as currently Tesla 
                (AV car manufactures) is having to pay the government a huge bailout for all the recent crashes.

            <br>This is an interview of sorts that an investigative reporter for CNN did on a Tesla model 3 selfdriving feature. The reporter testing the car took it to both a busy street in a city and a
            simple straight-forward road on the outskirts of the city using the self-driving feature to
            navigate his way through. In the video I saw the numerous amounts of time the reporter
            had to take the wheel of the car when he drove through the city and sometime the car
            would hesitate to make decisions due to the hectic nature of the city. During the outskirts
            drive the car did much better, only really having to drive on a quite simple road. This video
            was used as more of a backup on how AVs still need some more work done on them before
            they can go out to the public. </p>

                I chose this image to show what a substanable future could look like. The whole point of my paper is to pursuade the reader to look into AV's. 
                The image relates to my topic as all AV's are electric cars, which is far better than gasoline powered vehicals. This image gives a visual image of my paper
                and the ideas behind my paper. It also shows what my research could lead too in a whole new world of substanability.

                This image was more for fun as it was used to show the ending of my website. This doesn't have to much refrence to my paper as its only being used to make a statement. 
                The reason I went for this image was because it brings back memories to many peoples childhoods. It was something of enjoyment rather than a relationship to 
                my paper. This image is open for public use but not for sales use du to copy rights, as in you can use the the Gif but not in a way you make money.

                This image relates to the last sentence of my conclusion: <cite>"The journey to create a sustainable, reliable, and safe vehicle is only a short drive away."</cite>. I find the image to be a perfect ending for
                Paper/ website as well as create a correlation of driving and substanability at the same time. This relates to my topic as it visualizes a night time drive 
                throught the city with a AV. What makes this image apeal to me is the cool aesthetic, I beilve this will also impress the reader as well. I am hopeful that in 10 years
                I will be able to make this drive without the need to drive but simply enjoy the ride in my AV. This is also a free to use gif on a stock website.
