# Research-Paper-Website-
This website was a project for my IT104 class (Introduction to Computing) at George Mason University : The website was hand coded using both basic HTML and CSS to create my first static website that introduces the topic of Self driving vehicles. The content of the website is based heavily on a research paper on the same topic

You do not have permision to copy, distribute, or use my code in any type of way.

Here is the finished product: http://mason.gmu.edu/~dtalley/index.html
